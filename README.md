About PyColony
========

PyColony is a Python implementation of the strategy game "Colony" originally released by Midnight Synergy. Unfortunately, the original game is very old and runs poorly on newer versions of Windows. PyColony has identical game mechanics to the original and provides a simple API for those interested in modifying or extending the functionality of the game. Consequently, this project is a good candidate for artificial intelligence and teaching and learning purposes. At the time of writing this wiki, PyColony runs in a terminal and does not yet include a GUI, though it provides ASCII graphics with toggleable color support in ANSI. I encourage you to browse this project, and I welcome corrections, questions, and comments.
